Wheat Kernel Decision Tree Analysis

Dataset:

seeds_dataset_class.csv

Objectives:

1. Decision Tree Learning:

- Learn a decision tree for the three classes of wheat kernel.

2. Testing & Pruning:

- Evaluate the decision tree's accuracy on test data.
- Apply varying degrees of pruning using the prune function to assess the tree's performance.

3. Visualization & Evaluation:

- Visualize two selected variables of the data via scatterplot, and color code according to the decision tree output.
- Display the learnt decision tree structure.
- Calculate and report the decision tree's accuracy.

4. Comparison with KNN:

- Contrast the accuracy of the various pruned trees against K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method for varying values of k.
